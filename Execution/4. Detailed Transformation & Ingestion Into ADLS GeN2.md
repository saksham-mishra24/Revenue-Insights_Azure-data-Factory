# Here is Detailed breakdown of the transformations performed in project:

## Source Tables:

### üìëStarted with two tables, "bookings" and "hotels," which served as the source for your transformation.

## :one: Join Transformation:

### I performed a join operation between the "bookings" and "hotels" tables based on a common column, likely "property_id," to combine the data from both tables into a single dataset.

## :two: Derived Columns Transformation:

### After the join, I created several derived columns using the derived column transformation. Here are the derived columns you mentioned:

* - Stay_duration: Calculated based on check-in and check-out dates to determine the length of stay.
* - Cancelled_bookings: Derived column indicating the number of bookings that were canceled.
* - Checked_out: Derived column indicating the number of bookings that were checked out.
* - No_show: Derived column indicating the number of bookings where guests did not show up.

## :three: Select Columns Transformation:

* - Following the derived column transformation, I selected a subset of columns from the combined dataset. 

* - These selected columns likely represent the specific information you wanted to include in your final output.

## :four:  Aggregate Transformation:

### I applied the aggregate transformation to summarize the data and calculate various measures. 

* The measures you mentioned are as follows:

* - Revenue_realized: Total revenue realized from the bookings.
* - Revenue_generated: Total revenue generated from the bookings.
* - Total_bookings: Total number of bookings.
* - Total_Cancelled_bookings: Total number of bookings that were canceled.
* - Total_checked_out: Total number of bookings that were checked out.
* - Total_no_show: Total number of bookings where guests did not show up.
* - Average_ratings: Average ratings given by guests.
* - Cancellation %: Percentage of bookings that were canceled.
* - NoShow%: Percentage of bookings where guests did not show up.
* - ADR (Average Daily Rate): Average revenue per day.
* - no_guests: Total number of guests.
* - room_category: Category of the room booked.
* - booking_status: Status of the booking.
* - Stay_duration: Duration of the stay.

###  The aggregation was performed by grouping the data based on the following columns:

* - city
* - Booking_id
* - Property_name
* - Property_id
* - category
* - booking_platform
## :five: Union Transformation:

### After the aggregation, I used the union transformation to combine the desired columns into a single dataset.


## :six: Sink Transformation:

### I used the sink transformation to load the transformed data into the Azure SQL Database & ADLS Gen2 "processed" folder. 

### This step involved storing the final output of your transformation pipeline.


## üÖ∞Ô∏è Aggregated_Booking Table Join:

I joined the "aggregated_booking" table with the previously joined table (booking+hotel) to incorporate additional information or enrich the dataset.

## :one: Aggregated Function:

* - Following the join, you applied aggregated functions to create additional measures based on the joined dataset. 

* - The specific functions and measures created were not mentioned, so you may want to provide more details about the specific calculations you performed.

## :two: Select Columns Transformation:

After applying the aggregated functions, you selected specific columns from the joined dataset, likely choosing the relevant information for your final output.

## :three: Sink Transformation:

### :jack_o_lantern: Finally, I used the sink transformation to store the transformed data from the joined dataset, potentially in another location or folder.
